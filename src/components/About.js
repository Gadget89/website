      I began my journey to become a software developer in the Fall of 2016. I've had the great privilege to learn from accomplished instructors at The Iron Yard and I graduated from their Front-End Engineering program in February 2017.

    <p>
      After gaining a solid foundation, I am excited for this lifetime adventure. My curiosity and passion for code continue driving me to keep learning as much as I can.

      I would like to join a great team and be involved in projects that I can be proud of. I invite you to check out my projects and please feel free to contact me.
